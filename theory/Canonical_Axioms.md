**Introduction** 

This document specifies the canonical axioms of the Language of Stress (LoS) theory of consciousness. These axioms constitute the formal foundation from which all theoretical claims, empirical predictions, and applications derive. 

**Purpose:** 

This document serves as: 

1. The definitive reference for LoS theoretical commitments   
2. A falsification target for empirical research   
3. A foundation for extensions and applications 

**Usage:** 

When citing specific LoS claims, reference both the main theoretical paper (Pace, 2026\) and the specific axiom number from this document. Example: "According to LoS Axiom 4, the Archetype of Self organizes the Value Topography (Pace, 2026)." 

**Versioning:** 

This is version 1.0. Any substantive changes to axioms will increment the version number and receive a new DOI. Minor clarifications will be noted in the "Clarifying Commitments" section without version change.

**Axioms**

### **Axiom 1 — Consciousness Is Value-Bearing**

Conscious experience is fundamentally normative: every conscious state is experienced as mattering to the organism to some degree.

Consciousness is not neutral information processing; it is intrinsically evaluative.

### **Axiom 2 — Valenced Tension Dynamics Are the Primitive Currency of Experience**

The basic units of subjective experience are *topographical distortions* created by *valenced tension dynamics*: *stress* (aversive distortion), *eustress* (appetitive distortion), and *relief* (resolution). These dynamics constitute the brain's epistemic mechanism for value substantiation. 

### **Axiom 3 — The Phenomenological Field Is a Value Topography**

At any moment, conscious experience consists of a constantly fluctuating, unified landscape of value gradients, termed a *Value Topography*, composed of many simultaneous valenced tension dynamics.

The phenomenological “field” of consciousness is the configuration of gradients on this unified Value Topography, not a collection of discrete representations.

### **Axiom 4 — The Archetype of Self Organizes the Value Topography**

The Value Topography is hierarchically organized around the *Archetype of Self*—the most defended, most rigorously maintained, and most information-dense structure. Distortions are weighted by self-relevance:deviations threatening or validating the Self create disproportionate topographical change. Other conscious entities can be architecturally integrated into one's Self-model, such that their states directly create distortions within one's own topography (the mechanism of empathy and altruism).

**Axiom 5 \- Constructed Distortion (Stress, Eustress, and Relief)**

In conscious experience, phenomenological urgency and prioritization (topographical distortion) do not arise from deviation or arousal alone. Topographical distortions emerge only through the interaction of deviations—which may be single or multiple simultaneous—from defended archetypes, the rigidity with which those archetypes are held, the pre-cognitive interpretation of the significance of the collective pattern, and the degree of self-relevance. 

**Topographical Distortion ∝ Σ(Deviationi × Rigidityi) × Interpretation × Self-Relevance** 

This formula describes topographical change experienced as stress (aversive distortion), eustress (appetitive distortion), or relief (resolution of distortions). The term 'eustress' derives from the Greek 'eu-' (good), distinguishing positive motivational tension from harmful stress. As a consequence, tension and topographical distortion are dissociable: a deviation can generate tension without generating significant phenomenal urgency, if interpretation and self-relevance are low.

### **Axiom 6 — Attention Follows Value Gradients**

Attention is guided by the magnitude, rigidity, instability, and self-relevance of topographical distortions within the value topography.

What becomes salient in consciousness is determined by priority and normative significance, not informational richness or global availability alone.

### **Axiom 7 — Unity of Consciousness Arises from Coherent Valuation**

The unity of conscious experience arises from the integration of value gradients into a single, dynamically coherent Value Topography organized around the Archetype of Self. Unity is maintained even as contents vary because attention follows the largest distortions relative to the current topographical state, determined by deviation magnitude, archetype rigidity, and self-relevance.

### **Axiom 8 — Emotional Qualia Are Geometric Patterns of Tension Dynamics**

Emotions correspond to distinct geometric patterns within the Value Topography, characterized by specific relationships among tension magnitude, distribution, rigidity, and resolution trajectories. Emotional “feel” is the distinctive pattern of topographical warping or resolution within experiential space.

These patterns are algorithmic—characterized by specific geometric relationships that are substrate-independent in principle. Whether non-biological substrates can instantiate the phenomenal aspect of these patterns remains an open empirical question, though biological systems achieve this through hormonal and neurotransmitter feedback mechanisms that substantiate the geometric distortions.

### **Axiom 9 — Cognitive Content Is Modulated by Value**

Concepts, thoughts, perceptions, and memories enter consciousness insofar as they are embedded within or modulated by valenced tension dynamics.

Cognition without value remains unconscious or background processing.

### **Axiom 10 — Altered States Correspond to Altered Value Geometry**

Altered states of consciousness (e.g., meditation, flow, psychedelics, dissociation) correspond to systematic transformations in the geometry of the Value Topography, including changes in gradient magnitude, distribution, coherence, and archetypal rigidity.

### **Axiom 11 — Phenomenological Quality Is Identical to Valuative Structure**

The qualitative character (“what it is like”) of experience is identical to the structure of valenced tension dynamics—that is, the configuration of topographical changes within the Value Topography—not an emergent property layered atop physical processes.

There is no additional phenomenal substance beyond valuation structure.

### **Axiom 12 — Consciousness Is a Language of Priority**

Consciousness functions as an internal language of priority through which the organism encodes, negotiates, and resolves competing values across time.

Subjective experience is how priority is expressed, not how information is displayed.

**Axiom 13 — Uniform Valenced Epistemology of the Self**

The Archetype of Self and all Self-relevant archetypes are evaluated by the same valenced epistemological mechanism that the brain applies to all archetypes. Negative deviations of the Self from defended standards generate stress; attenuation, correction, or resolution of such deviations generates relief. These valenced states directly substantiate judgments of self-worth, adequacy, or deficiency.

Deviations may be explicit or normalized within the Value Topography; in cases of normalized deviation, relief may be experienced as a positive deviation when previously latent stress is reduced or revealed through its resolution.

The Self has no privileged epistemic status: its value is known through experienced deviation and its resolution, not through reflection, reasoning, or social inference.

*In many cases, deviations within the Self are chronically defended and become normalized within the Value Topography, ceasing to register phenomenologically as stress. Relief in such cases can be experienced as unexpectedly positive, not because the Self exceeds defended standards, but because previously latent deviation is suddenly reduced. The relief retroactively reveals the presence of tension that had been taken as baseline, much as an unexpected back rub reveals muscular tension that had gone unnoticed.*

## **Clarifying Commitments (Canonical, Non-Axiomatic)**

* The Language of Stress is value-primitive, not information-primitive.  
* “Normative” refers to value-bearing significance for the organism—states that register as better or worse, more or less urgent, independent of explicit deliberation or moral judgment.  
* Stress is defined normatively, not colloquially or as mere psychological strain.  
* Eustress is appetitive topographical distortion—positive motivational tension toward goals, ideals, or growth. It is phenomenally distinct from stress (aversive) and relief (resolution), though all three arise from the same formula.  
* *Hidden stress* refers to chronic baseline tension from defended archetypes that persistently deviate from ideal states—'baked into' the topography and invisible until relieved.  
* The theory is materialist-compatible, but does not reduce phenomenology to computation alone.  
* LoS is distinct from affective labeling theories, reinforcement learning, predictive processing, Integrated Information Theory, and Global Workspace Theory, though it may coexist with or constrain them.  
* The Archetype of Self is not a homunculus or central processor—it is a defended structure within the topography that organizes value gradients hierarchically through self-relevance weighting.  
* Architectural integration of other Selves (empathy mechanism) is not simulation or Theory of Mind—it is literal partial merging of self-models within one's Value Topography.  
* Rigidity is not stubbornness or inflexibility—it is the defensive intensity with which archetypes are held, determining sensitivity to deviations.  
* The theory predicts consciousness requires specific architecture, not merely high complexity, information integration, or global broadcasting.

## **Falsification Criteria**

The Language of Stress theory is falsifiable through the following predictions:

* If self-relevant weak signals do NOT reliably capture attention over non-self-relevant strong signals, the theory is falsified.  
* If self-model fragmentation does NOT fragment consciousness (controlling for neural integration), the theory is falsified.  
* If consciousness is observed in systems lacking unified value assessment mechanisms, the theory is falsified.  
* If rigidity scores do NOT predict mental health pathology severity better than symptom counts, the theory is falsified.

These predictions distinguish LoS from competing theories and provide clear experimental targets.

## **Status**

This document constitutes the canonical axiomatic formulation (v1.0) of the Language of Stress theory of consciousness. All extensions, applications, empirical predictions, and comparisons should be interpreted as deriving from these commitments.
