# Global Workspace Theory: Where We Converge and Diverge

## Quick Summary

Global Workspace Theory (GWT), developed by Bernard Baars and extended by Stanislas
Dehaene, proposes that consciousness arises when information is broadcast to a "global
workspace" accessible to multiple cognitive systems. Information that wins the competition for
workspace access becomes conscious. The Language of Stress agrees that consciousness
involves selective attention and resource allocation, but argues that GWT explains **access**
(which information gets broadcast) without explaining **phenomenology** (why accessing
information feels like anything). GWT describes the theater of consciousness; the Language of
Stress explains why there's an audience experiencing the show.

## Core Claims of Global Workspace Theory

GWT is the most influential theory in cognitive science and one of the most intuitive frameworks
for understanding consciousness. Its core claims:

1. **Consciousness is global access:** Information becomes conscious when it's broadcast
    to a global workspace accessible to multiple cognitive modules (perception, memory,
    action planning, language, etc.)
2. **Competition for workspace:** At any moment, multiple information streams compete for
    limited workspace capacity. The "winner" becomes conscious; losers remain
    unconscious
3. **Broadcasting enables coordination:** Workspace access allows otherwise independent
    modules to coordinate and share information—enabling flexible, adaptive behavior
4. **Attention is the selection mechanism:** Attention determines which information wins
    the competition and gets broadcast
5. **Unconscious processing is widespread:** Most cognitive processing occurs in
    specialized, unconscious modules. Only workspace-broadcast information is conscious
6. **Working memory is the workspace:** The neural correlate of the global workspace is
    primarily the prefrontal cortex and associated working memory systems
7. **Neural ignition:** Conscious access involves sudden, widespread activation across brain
    networks—unconscious processing is local, conscious processing is global


8. **Theater metaphor:** Consciousness is like a theater with a spotlight (attention)
    illuminating actors (information) on stage (workspace), making them visible to the
    audience (cognitive systems)
These claims are supported by extensive neuroimaging evidence and provide clear predictions
about neural activity patterns during conscious vs. unconscious processing.

## Core Claims of the Language of Stress

The Language of Stress makes overlapping but crucially distinct claims:

1. **Consciousness is integrated value assessment:** Information becomes conscious
    when it creates sufficient topographical distortion (tension/stress) relative to the
    Archetype of Self, demanding prioritization
2. **Competition is value-weighted:** Information competes based on phenomenal urgency
    (how much it threatens or supports self-model coherence), not just signal strength or
    novelty
3. **Integration enables prioritization:** Unified workspace allows heterogeneous demands
    (hunger, social threat, deadline, moral conflict) to be compared through phenomenal
    intensity
4. **Attention follows topographical distortion:** Attention is drawn to information creating
    the largest distortions in the Value Topography—self-relevant deviations automatically
    capture workspace
5. **Unconscious processing includes value assessment:** Many value judgments occur
    unconsciously, bubbling to consciousness only when sufficiently self-relevant or when
    resolution requires deliberation
6. **The workspace is organized around Self:** The neural correlate includes prefrontal
    systems but fundamentally requires self-network integration (DMN, medial
    PFC)—without unified self-model, workspace fragments
7. **Phenomenal ignition is valenced pressure:** The "ignition" isn't just widespread
    activation—it's the felt urgency of topographical distortion demanding resolution
8. **Theater metaphor extended:** The spotlight (attention) is pulled by topographical
    distortions (stress gradients). The audience (Self) doesn't just observe—it feels
    threatened or relieved by what's illuminated. The experience is the caring, not just the
    seeing.

## Where We Converge: Shared Ground

GWT and the Language of Stress share fundamental insights:


### 1. Selective Access Is Essential

Both theories recognize that consciousness is selective—not all information processing is
conscious, only information that meets certain criteria.
**GWT:** Information must win competition for workspace access.
**LoS:** Information must create sufficient topographical distortion (self-relevant deviation).

### 2. Integration Enables Flexibility

Both emphasize that consciousness involves integrating information across specialized
systems.
**GWT:** Workspace broadcasting allows independent modules to coordinate.
**LoS:** Unified Value Topography allows heterogeneous demands to be compared and prioritized.

### 3. Competition Determines Content

Both propose that conscious content results from competition among potential contents.
**GWT:** Strongest/most salient signals win workspace access.
**LoS:** Largest topographical distortions (self-relevant tensions) capture attention.

### 4. Working Memory Is Central

Both identify prefrontal/working memory systems as crucial for consciousness.
**GWT:** Workspace is implemented in prefrontal cortex and associated networks.
**LoS:** Cognitive control (Master Agent) requires prefrontal systems to navigate Value
Topography and modulate rigidity.

### 5. Unconscious Processing Is Extensive

Both acknowledge that most brain activity is unconscious.
**GWT:** Only workspace-broadcast information is conscious; module-local processing is
unconscious.
**LoS:** Most deviations are processed unconsciously as value information; only self-relevant
deviations create conscious phenomenal pressure.

### 6. Sudden Transitions


Both predict threshold-like transitions between unconscious and conscious states.
**GWT:** Neural ignition—sudden widespread activation when information enters workspace.
**LoS:** Threshold crossing—when deviation × rigidity × self-relevance exceeds threshold,
distortion becomes consciously salient.
**These convergences are real and important. The question is whether GWT provides a
complete explanation, or whether something crucial is missing.**

## Where We Diverge: The Core Disagreements

### 1. Access vs. Phenomenology

**GWT:** Explains what gets conscious (access) but not why it feels like anything
(phenomenology).
**LoS:** Explains both access (self-relevant deviations capture attention) and phenomenology
(valenced tension is what consciousness feels like).
**Why this matters:
GWT's core claim:** When information is broadcast to the global workspace, it becomes
conscious—accessible to multiple systems for report, memory, action planning.
**But this leaves the Hard Problem untouched:** Why does access feel like anything? Why isn't
information broadcast, utilized by downstream systems, and stored in memory all "in the
dark"—without any phenomenal experience?
**The zombie objection applied to GWT:** You could imagine a system with perfect workspace
broadcasting, global ignition, flexible information sharing—all the functional features GWT
describes—but no phenomenal experience. Information gets accessed and used, but there's no
"what it's like" to be that system.
**GWT response:** Typically defers to other theories or suggests phenomenology is beyond scope
(GWT explains access consciousness, not phenomenal consciousness).
**LoS response:** Access and phenomenology are inseparable in self-maintaining systems.
Information creates phenomenal experience when it threatens or supports self-model coherence
because phenomenal intensity IS the mechanism by which priority is determined.
**The feeling isn't separate from the accessing—it's WHY certain information wins the
competition.**


### 2. Why Information Wins Competition

**GWT:** Information wins based on signal strength, salience, novelty, current goals, or bottom-up
attention capture.
**LoS:** Information wins based on topographical distortion magnitude—deviation × rigidity ×
self-relevance.
**Why this matters:
GWT struggles to explain prioritization among incommensurable information types:**
You're working on a complex problem (high prefrontal activation, strong workspace
engagement). Suddenly you smell smoke. Immediately, the problem disappears from
consciousness and threat-detection dominates.
**GWT explanation:** Smoke is highly salient, triggers bottom-up attention capture, overrides
current workspace content.
**But why is smoke more salient than the complex problem?** Both involve information
processing. Both activate multiple systems. The problem might involve more neural activity,
more workspace integration.
**LoS explanation:** Smoke threatens physiological archetypes (safety, survival) deeply nested in
Archetype of Self. Even faint smoke signal creates massive topographical distortion because
rigidity for survival archetypes is maximum and self-relevance is absolute.
The complex problem, however engaging, is peripheral to Self-integrity. Its topographical
distortion is smaller despite greater informational complexity.
**The smoke wins not because it's "more salient" but because it threatens what you
fundamentally are.
GWT can describe the outcome (smoke wins workspace) but can't explain the
mechanism (why smoke beats the problem).**

### 3. The Role of Self

**GWT:** The self is one type of information that can enter workspace—useful for metacognition
and self-reflection, but not architecturally special.


**LoS:** The Archetype of Self is the organizing principle of the entire Value Topography. All other
information is weighted by its relationship to Self-integrity.
**Why this matters:
GWT treats self-information as workspace content among other contents:**
● Sometimes you're conscious of yourself (self-reflection, introspection)
● Sometimes you're conscious of external information (perceiving, problem-solving)
● Self-awareness is one mode among many
**LoS treats Self as the workspace organizer:**
● ALL information is evaluated relative to Self (even when you're not explicitly thinking
about yourself)
● Self-relevance determines which information creates sufficient distortion to capture
workspace
● The Self isn't content in the workspace—it's the gravity field determining what enters
**Empirical implications:
Depersonalization disorder:** Patients report intact perception and cognition but loss of
self-experience—feeling like they're observing themselves from outside, like nothing feels real
or theirs.
**GWT prediction:** Should show normal workspace function (information still broadcast and
accessible).
**LoS prediction:** Should show specific self-network dysfunction (DMN disruption) that fragments
the organizing principle, even though workspace broadcasting continues.
**Empirical reality:** Depersonalization shows relatively preserved cognitive function and
information access, but specific disruption in self-network (supports LoS).
**The self isn't just one kind of workspace content—it's the structure organizing all
workspace content.**

### 4. What Makes Information "Salient"?

**GWT:** Salience is determined by stimulus properties (intensity, contrast, novelty), current goals,
or learned associations.
**LoS:** Salience is determined by topographical distortion—which is a function of deviation
magnitude, archetype rigidity, and self-relevance.


**Why this matters:
GWT lacks a principled account of salience.** It treats salience as a given property of
information or as determined by context, but doesn't explain what makes information salient.
**Examples where GWT struggles:
Your name in background noise (cocktail party effect):
GWT explanation:** Your name is "salient" because it's self-relevant and thus captures attention,
entering workspace.
**But this is circular:** Why is it self-relevant? What makes self-relevant information salient?
**LoS explanation:** Your name is strongly associated with your Archetype of Self. Even weak
acoustic signal creates topographical distortion because it's recognized as self-related. The
distortion magnitude (deviation × rigidity × self-relevance) exceeds threshold, capturing
workspace.
This is mechanistic, not circular—self-relevance creates distortion, distortion determines
salience, salience captures workspace.
**Minor criticism vs. major identity threat:**
You're receiving feedback on your work. Two scenarios:

1. **Minor technical criticism:** "This sentence is awkwardly phrased"
2. **Major identity threat:** "You're fundamentally incompetent"
**GWT:** Both are salient feedback, might both enter workspace, differ in intensity somehow.
**LoS:** (2) creates vastly larger topographical distortion because it threatens core archetypes
nested in Self ("I am competent" is central to professional identity). (1) creates minimal distortion
(peripheral skill archetype).
(2) dominates consciousness not because the signal is stronger or more novel, but because it
threatens what you are.
**GWT can observe these salience differences but can't explain them. LoS provides the
mechanism.**

### 5. Unity of Consciousness

**GWT:** Unity emerges from having one workspace with limited capacity—only one dominant
coalition of information can be broadcast at a time.


**LoS:** Unity emerges from having one integrated Archetype of Self organizing the Value
Topography—all distortions compete within a single evaluative field.
**Why this matters:
GWT's capacity-limitation account of unity:**
At any moment, only so much information can be in the workspace. This creates phenomenal
unity—you experience one coherent stream of consciousness because workspace capacity is
limited.
**But this predicts unity should break when capacity is divided:
Dual-task scenarios:** When performing two demanding tasks simultaneously, GWT predicts
consciousness should fragment (can't fully broadcast both to workspace).
**What actually happens:** Consciousness remains unified. You experience both tasks as
competing for your unified attention—you feel torn between them, experience difficulty, but don't
have two separate streams of consciousness.
**LoS explanation:** Both tasks create topographical distortions. They compete within one unified
evaluative field. You experience unified struggle (one Self being pulled in two directions), not
fragmented consciousness.
**Split-brain patients:**
When corpus callosum is severed, left and right hemispheres can't directly communicate.
**GWT prediction:** Should have two separate workspaces, two streams of consciousness.
**LoS prediction:** Depends on whether one unified Archetype of Self can be maintained or
whether it fragments into two separate self-models.
**Evidence suggests:** Split-brain patients show complex, situation-dependent
unity/fragmentation that seems more about self-model organization than workspace capacity.

### 6. Emotion and Valence

**GWT:** Emotions are types of information that can enter workspace. When emotion-relevant
information is broadcast, you consciously experience emotion.
**LoS:** Emotions are specific geometric patterns of tension, stress, relief, and value across the
topography. They're not information that enters workspace—they're the structure of
topographical distortions themselves.


**Why this matters:
GWT treats emotions as workspace content:**
● Emotion-processing modules generate emotional information
● When this information enters workspace, you feel the emotion
● Emotions are contents of consciousness
**LoS treats emotions as the medium of consciousness:**
● All workspace content is valenced (creates distortions)
● Emotions are specific patterns of how the topography is distorted
● Emotions are not contents but structural features of phenomenal experience
**Example: Fear during problem-solving**
You're working on a difficult problem under time pressure. You feel anxiety.
**GWT explanation:** Problem-solving information is in workspace AND emotion-related
information (anxiety) is in workspace. You're conscious of both the problem and the anxiety.
**LoS explanation:** The problem-solving creates topographical distortion (deadline archetype,
competence archetype under threat). The anxiety ISN'T separate content—it's the phenomenal
character of the distortion pattern itself (anticipated negative deviation + insufficient control +
time pressure).
**The difference:** GWT has anxiety as additional information taking up workspace capacity. LoS
has anxiety as the felt structure of the workspace distortion.
**This explains why:**
● You can't "remove" anxiety from experience without changing the task (it's not separate
content—it's how the distortion feels)
● Anxiety affects all processing (it's the medium, not just content)
● Emotion is pervasive in consciousness (everything has valence because everything
creates some distortion)

### 7. Why Consciousness Exists (Functional Role)

**GWT:** Consciousness exists to enable flexible information sharing and coordination across
specialized modules.
**LoS:** Consciousness exists to enable prioritization across incommensurable demands through
phenomenal weighting.


**Why this matters:
GWT's functional story:**
Brain has many specialized modules (visual processing, language, motor planning, memory).
Modules need to coordinate for flexible behavior. Broadcasting information to global workspace
lets modules share information they couldn't otherwise access.
**This is true but incomplete—it explains access, not phenomenology:**
Why does this coordination require phenomenal experience? Why couldn't modules share
information through unconscious broadcasting?
**The unconscious coordination objection:** Many systems coordinate without consciousness
(cerebellum coordinates complex motor movements, autonomic system coordinates
physiological parameters). If consciousness is just information sharing, why isn't everything
conscious?
**LoS's functional story:**
Brain must simultaneously manage:
● Homeostatic needs (hunger, thirst, temperature, pain)
● Long-term goals (career, relationships, meaning)
● Immediate threats (predators, social rejection, deadlines)
● Abstract values (morality, identity, principles)
These demands are incommensurable—you can't compare "3 units of hunger" to "5 units of
deadline anxiety" using a shared information metric.
**Phenomenal intensity provides the common currency:** Whichever demand creates larger
topographical distortion (feels more urgent) wins prioritization.
**This explains why consciousness is necessary:** Without phenomenal weighting, the system
has no basis for determining what matters most right now among fundamentally different types
of demands.
**GWT explains coordination. LoS explains prioritization through phenomenal urgency.**

## What the Language of Stress Explains That GWT Doesn't

### 1. Why Access Feels Like Something (The Hard Problem)


**The problem:** GWT explains which information becomes conscious (wins workspace access)
but not why accessing information is accompanied by phenomenal experience.
**GWT answer:** Access consciousness is all there is. When information is globally accessible,
that's consciousness. Phenomenology might be beyond scientific explanation.
**Why this is unsatisfying:**
We all know phenomenal experience is real—there's something it's like to see red, feel pain,
taste coffee. This isn't just information being accessible to cognitive systems. It's experiencing.
**Block's distinction:** Access consciousness (information available for report, reasoning, action)
≠ Phenomenal consciousness (what it feels like).
GWT explains access. But phenomenal consciousness is what needs explaining.
**LoS answer:** Phenomenal experience IS the mechanism by which information gains priority
among competing demands in a self-maintaining system.
When you see red, the phenomenal redness isn't separate from processing—it's the valenced
assessment of that perceptual deviation relative to your color archetypes. The feeling IS the
evaluation.
When you feel pain, the phenomenal badness isn't separate from nociceptive processing—it's
the system's registration that physiological archetypes are being violated and self-preservation
is threatened.
**The experience is the caring.** A system without stakes (no defended self-model) might
process and broadcast information but wouldn't feel anything because there's no evaluative
dimension—no phenomenal weighting determining what matters.
**GWT describes the structure of access. LoS explains why access in self-maintaining
systems must feel like something.**

### 2. Why Attention Is Selective (The Competition Mechanism)

**The problem:** What determines which information wins the competition for workspace access?
**GWT answer:** Salience, novelty, relevance to current goals, bottom-up attention capture,
top-down attention direction.
**Why this is incomplete:**
These are descriptions of outcomes, not mechanisms. Saying "salient information wins" just
rephrases the question: what makes information salient?


**LoS answer:** Information wins based on topographical distortion magnitude = deviation ×
rigidity × self-relevance.
**This provides a quantifiable mechanism:
Example 1: Background noise vs. your name**
● Background conversation: Creates small deviations from language archetypes, low
rigidity (not defending listening to others), zero self-relevance
○ **Distortion:** ~0 (stays unconscious)
● Your name: Creates large deviation (unexpected self-reference), moderate rigidity,
maximum self-relevance
○ **Distortion:** Large (captures workspace immediately)
**Example 2: Complex problem vs. sudden pain**
● Interesting problem: Large information, high engagement, moderate rigidity, low
self-relevance (intellectual not survival)
○ **Distortion:** Moderate (holds workspace while engaging)
● Sudden finger pain: Small information (simple signal), maximum rigidity (physiological
archetype), high self-relevance (body integrity)
○ **Distortion:** Massive (immediately dominates workspace)
**The formula is mechanistic:** You can predict what wins workspace by calculating which
creates the largest distortion in the Value Topography.
**GWT has no comparable mechanism—just lists of factors that "affect salience."**

### 3. Why We Care About Anything

**The problem:** Why do we prefer some workspace contents over others? Why does accessing
painful information feel bad? Why does accessing pleasant information feel good?
**GWT answer:** ...largely silent. Information can be categorized as positive or negative based on
content, but GWT doesn't explain why we experience valence.
**LoS answer:** Valence IS the phenomenal assessment of whether information represents
deviation toward or away from self-model coherence.
● **Feels bad:** Information represents threat to archetypes (pain = tissue damage,
embarrassment = social archetype violation, failure = competence archetype deviation)
● **Feels good:** Information represents relief (resolution of hunger, achievement of goal,
social connection)


**This explains phenomena GWT struggles with:
Why "boring" information loses workspace despite high complexity:**
A detailed technical manual might contain massive information, require cognitive effort, engage
multiple systems—but if it's irrelevant to your goals (low self-relevance), it creates minimal
topographical distortion. Workspace access is weak and unstable.
**GWT:** Should maintain workspace access (information is complex, requires processing).
**LoS:** Minimal distortion means attention wanders despite information complexity.
**Why emotionally-charged simple information dominates complex neutral information:**
A simple insult ("You're stupid") might be informationally sparse but creates massive
topographical distortion (threatens competence archetype nested in Self).
**GWT:** Simple information should lose to complex information in workspace competition.
**LoS:** Large distortion (simple insult) beats small distortion (complex neutral content) regardless
of informational complexity.
**The phenomenal valence isn't a feature added to workspace content—it's the measure of
how much that content distorts the topography.**

### 4. Why Unity Fragments in Specific Ways

**The problem:** Consciousness can fragment in particular patterns—dissociative identity disorder,
depersonalization, hemispatial neglect. Why these specific fragmentations?
**GWT answer:** Unity fragments when workspace is divided or when ignition fails. Different
fragmentations reflect different workspace disruptions.
**Why this is incomplete:**
Many fragmentation disorders show relatively normal workspace function (information still
accessed, cognitive tasks performed) but specific phenomenal disruptions.
**LoS answer:** Unity fragments when the Archetype of Self fragments, regardless of workspace
capacity.
**Dissociative Identity Disorder:
GWT prediction:** Should show divided workspace—two separate ignition patterns competing.


**LoS prediction:** Should show competing self-models (different archetype structures) that
organize the same workspace differently depending on which alter is dominant.
**Evidence:** DID patients can switch alters while performing continuous tasks (suggesting
workspace remains functional). What changes is the organizing self-model.
Each alter has:
● Different archetypes (values, beliefs, preferences)
● Different rigidity patterns (what each defends intensely)
● Different self-relevance weights (what matters to each identity)
The workspace content is filtered through whichever self-model is currently dominant—same
information, different phenomenal experience.
**Depersonalization:
GWT prediction:** Should show reduced workspace access or impaired ignition.
**LoS prediction:** Should show intact workspace but fragmented self-network—information is
accessed but doesn't feel "mine" because self-model isn't organizing the topography normally.
**Evidence:** Depersonalization patients report:
● "I can see and think clearly" (workspace intact)
● "But it doesn't feel real" (self-organization disrupted)
● "I'm observing myself from outside" (self-model detached from experience)
This matches LoS prediction: access consciousness preserved, phenomenal organization
disrupted.
**Hemispatial neglect:**
After right parietal damage, patients ignore left side of space—not blind to it (can unconsciously
process left-side information) but don't attend to it, don't experience it as salient.
**GWT:** Left-side information fails to enter workspace (attention/ignition failure).
**LoS:** Left-side information fails to create topographical distortion (self-model doesn't include left
space as defended territory—deviations there aren't self-relevant).
**Evidence supports LoS:** Patients can unconsciously process left-side information (reaches
some level of access) but it doesn't feel salient or real (doesn't create phenomenal pressure).

### 5. Why Some Information Dominates Despite Low Signal Strength


**The problem:** Weak signals sometimes dominate consciousness while strong signals are
ignored.
**GWT answer:** Top-down attention can amplify weak signals, making them more likely to win
workspace competition.
**Why this is incomplete:** Doesn't explain what determines top-down attention direction.
**LoS answer:** Even weak signals create large topographical distortions if they're self-relevant
with high rigidity.
**Examples:
Faint sound that might be your child crying:**
● **Signal strength:** Very weak (ambiguous, distant, low SNR)
● **Information content:** Minimal (just faint sound)
● **GWT prediction:** Shouldn't win workspace (weak signal, competing with clearer signals)
● **What actually happens:** Immediately captures full attention
**LoS explanation:**
● Child safety deeply nested in Archetype of Self
● Safety archetypes held with maximum rigidity
● Even weak deviation creates massive distortion
● **Formula:** Small deviation × maximum rigidity × maximum self-relevance = dominant
distortion
**Subtle social cues suggesting rejection:**
● **Signal:** Slight change in tone, brief facial expression, small conversational shift
● **Information:** Minimal
● **GWT:** Shouldn't dominate rich conversation content
● **What happens:** Can dominate consciousness for hours afterward
**LoS explanation:**
● Social belonging archetypes central to Self for many people
● Rejection threats create disproportionate distortion
● Small deviation × high rigidity × high self-relevance = lasting dominant distortion
**Minor deviation in partner's behavior:**
Your spouse uses slightly different tone when saying goodnight. Objectively tiny signal. You
spend the next hour analyzing what it meant.
**GWT struggles:** Why does minimal information dominate workspace for extended period?


**LoS explains:** Relationship archetypes are deeply nested in Self, held with high rigidity. Even
tiny deviations create significant topographical distortion requiring resolution.

### 6. Why Consciousness Has Emotional Tone

**The problem:** Nearly all conscious experience has affective coloring—pleasant, unpleasant,
neutral. Why?
**GWT answer:** Emotion-processing modules can contribute information to workspace. When
emotional information is present, experience has emotional tone.
**Why this is incomplete:**
This treats emotion as optional content. But even "neutral" experiences have valence
(comfortable neutrality vs. uncomfortable boredom). And emotional tone affects all other
processing (anxiety colors how you interpret everything).
**LoS answer:** All consciousness is valenced because consciousness IS navigation of a Value
Topography. Every piece of information creates some distortion (deviation from archetypes), and
distortions are inherently valenced (toward or away from self-coherence).
**Even "neutral" experiences have valence:**
● **Comfortable neutrality:** Archetypes satisfied, low tension, mild relief
● **Uncomfortable boredom:** Eustress (ideal archetypes not being pursued), mild
anticipatory tension
● **Anxious neutrality:** Background stress from unresolved archetypes coloring all
experience
**Why emotions "infect" cognition:**
You're anxious about a deadline. Now every problem you encounter feels more frustrating,
every task feels more difficult, every interaction feels more stressful.
**GWT:** Anxiety information is in workspace along with task information. They're separate
contents both present.
**LoS:** Anxiety is the topographical distortion pattern (deadline archetype under threat +
insufficient time + competence pressure). This distortion affects how ALL information is
evaluated—other deviations are amplified because the topography is already warped.
**Emotion isn't separate workspace content—it's the current state of the topographical
field through which all content is filtered.**


### 7. Why Expertise Involves "Knowing What to Ignore"

**The problem:** Experts don't process more information than novices—they process less.
They've learned what's relevant and what's noise.
**GWT answer:** Experts have better selection mechanisms for workspace access (learned
attention patterns).
**Why this is incomplete:** Doesn't explain what determines relevance vs. noise.
**LoS answer:** Experts have refined their topographies—they've learned which deviations create
meaningful distortions (signal) and which are peripheral (noise).
**Examples:
Expert radiologist:**
Scans contain thousands of potential deviations from "normal anatomy" archetypes. Novices are
overwhelmed—everything seems potentially significant.
**GWT:** Expert has learned which features to attend to (better workspace access filters).
**LoS:** Expert has refined archetypes so that only pathology-indicating deviations create
significant distortion. Normal anatomical variations are recognized as peripheral (low rigidity for
those archetypes)—don't create enough distortion to demand conscious attention.
**Expert chess player:**
Sees patterns, not individual pieces. Immediately recognizes dangerous positions.
**GWT:** Expert has pattern-recognition that aids workspace access.
**LoS:** Expert has refined archetypes for positional structure. Deviations from "good position"
archetypes create immediate distortion (danger recognized). Random piece configurations
create minimal distortion (noise filtered).
**The expertise isn't just "better attention"—it's refined value mapping:** knowing what
matters (threatens/supports self-relevant goals) and what doesn't.

## Testable Predictions That Distinguish the Theories

### Prediction 1: Self-Relevance Overrides Signal Strength


**GWT predicts:** Workspace access determined primarily by signal strength, novelty, and current
task-relevance.
**LoS predicts:** Self-relevant weak signals capture workspace more than non-self-relevant strong
signals.
**Test:** Present participants with:

1. **Strong signal, low self-relevance:** Complex visual pattern, high contrast, novel
2. **Weak signal, high self-relevance:** Faint mention of participant's name or personal
    information in background
**Measure:**
● Workspace access (global ignition patterns via EEG)
● Conscious report (what did you notice?)
● Attention capture (reaction time disruption)
● Neural resource allocation
**GWT prediction:** (1) should show stronger workspace ignition.
**LoS prediction:** (2) should capture workspace despite weaker signal, because self-relevance
creates larger topographical distortion.

### Prediction 2: Unity Follows Self-Model, Not Workspace Capacity

**GWT predicts:** Unity fragments when workspace is divided or capacity exceeded (dual-task
interference creates fragmentation).
**LoS predicts:** Unity is preserved even under high cognitive load as long as self-model remains
integrated. Unity fragments when self-model fragments, even if workspace capacity is available.
**Test:** Compare:
**Condition A: High load, unified self**
● Demanding dual-task paradigm
● Both tasks framed as serving unified self-goal
**Condition B: Low load, fragmented self**
● Simple task
● But performed under identity-conflict conditions (asked to act against core values, or in
depersonalization-induction paradigm)


**Measure:**
● Phenomenological unity reports
● DMN connectivity (self-network integrity)
● Task-positive network activity (workspace engagement)
**GWT prediction:** Unity fragments in (A) due to capacity limits, preserved in (B).
**LoS prediction:** Unity preserved in (A) despite load, fragments in (B) when self-model is
disrupted.

### Prediction 3: Emotion Pervades All Content vs. Emotion as Separate

### Content

**GWT predicts:** Emotional and non-emotional content are separable workspace contents. Can
have workspace access without emotional coloring.
**LoS predicts:** All workspace content is valenced (creates topographical distortion). "Neutral" is
just minimal distortion, not absence of valence.
**Test:** Present stimuli varying in explicit emotional content:

1. Emotionally-charged images
2. "Neutral" images (everyday objects)
3. Abstract patterns
**Measure:**
● Explicit emotional ratings
● Implicit valence (approach/avoid tendencies, valenced priming)
● Amygdala/insula activation (affective processing)
● Integration between "emotional" and "cognitive" networks
**GWT prediction:** (1) shows emotional processing, (2) and (3) show minimal emotional
activation (separate systems).
**LoS prediction:** All show valence processing (even minimal—"neutral" has slight
positive/negative bias). Integration between affective and cognitive systems is continuous, not
discrete.

### Prediction 4: Consciousness Requires Self-Network Integrity


**GWT predicts:** Consciousness requires workspace function (prefrontal systems, global ignition
capacity). Self-network is one contributor but not necessary.
**LoS predicts:** Consciousness requires integrated self-network (DMN, medial PFC) to organize
workspace. Without self-model integrity, workspace may function but phenomenology
fragments.
**Test:** Depersonalization patients vs. controls
**Measure:**
● Workspace function (global ignition during conscious access tasks)
● Self-network integrity (DMN connectivity, medial PFC activation)
● Phenomenological reports (sense of reality, ownership, unity)
**GWT prediction:** Depersonalization should show workspace impairment if phenomenology is
disrupted.
**LoS prediction:** Workspace function relatively preserved, specific self-network disruption
explains phenomenological fragmentation.
**Empirical data:** Studies show depersonalization involves DMN disruption without proportional
workspace/cognitive impairment—supports LoS.

### Prediction 5: Topographical Distortion Predicts Attention Better Than

### Information Content

**GWT predicts:** Attention and workspace access correlate with information complexity, novelty,
or task-relevance.
**LoS predicts:** Attention correlates with topographical distortion = deviation × rigidity ×
self-relevance, independent of information complexity.
**Test:** Present information varying orthogonally on:
● **Complexity:** Simple vs. complex
● **Self-relevance:** High (personal feedback, identity-relevant) vs. Low (abstract,
other-focused)
**Four conditions:**

1. Complex + Self-relevant
2. Complex + Non-self-relevant
3. Simple + Self-relevant


4. Simple + Non-self-relevant
**Measure:**
● Attention capture
● Workspace access (global ignition)
● Sustained attention
● Memory encoding
**GWT prediction:** Complexity drives workspace access (1 & 2 > 3 & 4).
**LoS prediction:** Self-relevance drives workspace access (1 & 3 > 2 & 4).
**Critical comparison:** Simple + Self-relevant (3) vs. Complex + Non-self-relevant (2)
● **GWT:** (2) should dominate
● **LoS:** (3) should dominate

### Prediction 6: Emotional Context Affects All Processing vs. Is Separate

### Content

**GWT predicts:** Emotional content and cognitive content occupy separate workspace regions.
Can have one without the other.
**LoS predicts:** Emotional state (topographical distortion pattern) modulates ALL processing.
Cannot separate emotional and cognitive because emotion is the medium, not content.
**Test:** Induce emotional state (anxiety via time pressure + evaluated performance) then measure
processing of neutral stimuli.
**Measure:**
● Perception thresholds for neutral stimuli
● Memory encoding for neutral information
● Decision-making about neutral choices
● Neural processing of neutral content
**GWT prediction:** Emotional and neutral processing dissociable (can attend to neutral content
without emotional influence if emotion isn't workspace-dominant).
**LoS prediction:** Anxiety state (topographical distortion) affects ALL processing—neutral stimuli
are evaluated through anxious topography, creating systematically different processing.


**Expected:** Anxiety makes neutral stimuli seem more negative, decisions more risk-averse,
memory more negatively-biased—supporting LoS's claim that emotion is the evaluative
medium, not separate content.

### Prediction 7: Expertise Involves Refined Archetypes Not Just Better

### Attention

**GWT predicts:** Experts have better workspace access filters (learned attention patterns direct
information selection).
**LoS predicts:** Experts have refined archetypes (know which deviations matter) reflected in
different rigidity patterns and value assessments, not just attention.
**Test:** Expert vs. novice radiologists viewing X-rays
**Measure:**
● Initial attention patterns (eye-tracking during first pass)
● Value assessments (implicit urgency ratings for regions)
● Confidence in judgments
● Neural plasticity markers in visual cortex (archetype rigidity)
**GWT prediction:** Experts show better attention direction (faster fixation on relevant regions) but
similar value processing once attended.
**LoS prediction:** Experts show different value gradients (pathological deviations create larger
implicit distortions) AND different rigidity (high confidence for substantiated patterns, appropriate
uncertainty for ambiguous cases).
**Discriminating test:** Present ambiguous X-rays
● **GWT:** Experts and novices should show similar uncertainty (both lack clear attentional
cues)
● **LoS:** Experts show calibrated rigidity (low rigidity/high uncertainty for truly ambiguous,
maintained rigidity for subtle patterns they've substantiated)

## Toward Integration: Can GWT and LoS Be Synthesized?

Unlike the IIT comparison (where core identity claims conflict), GWT and LoS seem potentially
complementary:


### The Synthesis Possibility:

**GWT provides the architecture:** Global workspace, broadcasting mechanism, ignition
dynamics, access structure.
**LoS provides the mechanism:** What determines workspace competition (topographical
distortion), why access feels like something (phenomenal valence), how information is weighted
(self-relevance × rigidity).
**Combined view:**

1. **Workspace exists** (GWT is right about the functional architecture)
2. **But competition for workspace is value-weighted** (LoS specifies the mechanism)
3. **Workspace access enables flexible coordination** (GWT's functional story)
4. **But phenomenal experience arises because workspace comparison requires**
    **common currency** (LoS's phenomenological story)
5. **Neural ignition reflects global access** (GWT's neural correlate)
6. **But ignition is valenced pressure, not just information spread** (LoS's experiential
    correlate)

### Where They Layer:

**GWT Level:** The theater, the stage, the spotlight
● Workspace architecture (prefrontal systems)
● Broadcasting mechanism (global ignition)
● Access consciousness (information availability)
**LoS Level:** The script, the director, the audience's experience
● Value Topography (what determines relevance)
● Tension dynamics (what drives competition)
● Phenomenal consciousness (what access feels like)
**Together:** A complete theory explaining both structure and experience.

### What This Synthesis Explains:

**Why workspace exists:** Enables prioritization through phenomenal comparison (LoS) via
global broadcasting (GWT).
**Why workspace has limited capacity:** Phenomenal intensity can only weight finite information
at once (LoS) in unified evaluative space (GWT's workspace).
**Why ignition is threshold-like:** Topographical distortion must exceed threshold (LoS) to trigger
widespread activation (GWT's ignition).


**Why unity emerges:** Single workspace (GWT) organized around single Archetype of Self
(LoS).
**Why attention is selective:** Competition for workspace (GWT) determined by topographical
distortion magnitude (LoS).
**Why content varies:** Different information wins workspace (GWT) based on current
self-relevance and rigidity (LoS).

## What Would Change My Mind

**From LoS perspective:**
Language of Stress would need revision if:

1. **Consciousness occurred without self-network:** If patients showed phenomenal
    experience despite complete DMN disruption, this would challenge Self-organization
    requirement.
2. **Workspace access didn't correlate with self-relevance:** If purely information-theoretic
    factors (complexity, novelty) predicted workspace access better than topographical
    distortion, this would challenge the mechanism.
3. **Emotions were clearly separable content:** If we could demonstrate emotional and
    cognitive processing are truly independent (emotion can be "removed" from cognition),
    this would challenge valence-as-medium claim.
4. **Unity fragmented with load, not self-disruption:** If dual-task interference reliably
    fragmented phenomenal unity while self-model disruptions didn't, this would support
    GWT's capacity account over LoS's self-integration account.
**From GWT perspective:**
GWT would need revision if:
1. **Access didn't explain consciousness:** If systems showed clear workspace function
(global broadcasting, ignition) but no phenomenal experience, this would challenge
access-consciousness identity.
2. **Self-network was necessary:** If consciousness required specific self-model integrity
beyond general workspace function, this would challenge GWT's architecture-sufficiency.
3. **Salience required mechanistic account:** If "salience" needed explanation beyond
stimulus properties and goals (like value-weighting), this would require GWT expansion.
4. **Phenomenology couldn't be ignored:** If phenomenal consciousness (what it feels like)
is scientifically tractable and GWT doesn't address it, this would require theoretical
expansion.


## Closing Thoughts

Global Workspace Theory represents one of the most successful frameworks in cognitive
neuroscience. Bernard Baars and Stanislas Dehaene deserve enormous credit for:
● Making consciousness scientifically tractable
● Providing clear, testable predictions
● Identifying neural correlates (prefrontal systems, ignition dynamics)
● Explaining access consciousness and flexible cognition
● Creating framework that guides vast empirical research
The Language of Stress doesn't reject GWT—it extends it by addressing the dimension GWT
leaves unresolved: phenomenology.
**GWT tells us:**
● What gets conscious (workspace access)
● How it gets conscious (broadcasting, ignition)
● Where it gets conscious (neural networks)
● When it gets conscious (threshold crossing)
**GWT doesn't tell us:**
● Why it feels like something (phenomenal experience)
● What determines competition outcome (salience mechanism)
● Why we care (valence, motivation)
● How prioritization works (comparing incommensurables)
**LoS completes the picture:**
● Phenomenal experience IS the common currency for prioritization
● Competition is value-weighted (topographical distortion)
● We care because information threatens or supports Self
● Prioritization works through phenomenal intensity comparison
**The synthesis:**
GWT provides the theater. LoS explains why there's an audience, why they care, and what
makes performances compelling.
**Together:** Workspace broadcasting (GWT) enables unified phenomenal comparison (LoS)
necessary for prioritization in self-maintaining systems. Access consciousness (GWT) and


phenomenal consciousness (LoS) aren't separate phenomena—they're the structure and the
experience of the same process.
**Bernard Baars built the stage. The Language of Stress brings the script, the actors, and
the audience's emotional investment. Together, we have a complete theory of the theater
of consciousness.**
